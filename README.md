# Hi there!

<!--
**Lauchmelder23/Lauchmelder23** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

This github contains a bunch of private projects I worked on over the years – most of them unfinished (The most relevant repos are pinned). I prefer to work with low-level languages, however Python is also a favourite of mine. Recently I've been trying to learn about 3D graphics.
