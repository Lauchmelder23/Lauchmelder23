# Hi there! (archived)

I have migrated all my projects to my personal Forgejo instance at https://repos.einweckglas.com. If I decide to publish code it will be there.

This github contains a bunch of private projects I worked on over the years – most of them unfinished (The most relevant repos are pinned). I prefer to work with low-level languages, however Python is also a favourite of mine. Recently I've been trying to learn about 3D graphics and system emulation.
